## üîß Batch Script (`autorun.bat`)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **EXTREME CAUTION REQUIRED**

**This batch script performs aggressive system modifications that can be dangerous.**

### Critical Risks:
- **Modifies critical registry keys** without backup
- **Disables security services** (potentially including Windows Defender components)
- **Deletes system files and logs** that may be needed for recovery
- **No automatic rollback mechanism**
- **Can cause system instability or boot issues**

### What the Batch Script Does:

#### Section 1: Network Fixes
- Flushes DNS resolver cache
- Releases and renews IP configuration
- Resets Winsock catalog and TCP/IP stack
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Optional**: Complete firewall reset (removes ALL custom rules)

#### Section 2: System File & Disk Health
- Runs DISM repair operations
- Executes System File Checker (SFC)
- Schedules thorough Check Disk on next reboot

#### Section 3: OS Optimization & Cleanup
- Aggressive temporary file cleanup
- Clears Windows Update cache
- Disables Fast Startup
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Optional**: Clears display configuration cache (can cause boot issues)
- Forces Explorer restart
- Drive optimization

#### Section 4: Performance Tweaks
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Optional**: Disables visual effects and animations
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Optional**: Disables transparency effects
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Optional**: Forces high-performance power plan

#### Section 5: Privacy & Services (HIGH RISK)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Optional**: Disables Windows telemetry
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Optional**: Disables DiagTrack service
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Optional**: Disables CEIP tasks
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Optional**: Disables Cortana
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Optional**: Disables Windows Search (makes search unusable)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Optional**: Disables Superfetch/Sysmain

#### Section 6: Memory Optimization
- Provides guidance only (no automated actions)

#### Section 7: Update Maintenance (HIGH RISK)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Optional**: Resets Windows Update components
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Optional**: Triggers update scan

#### Section 8: BSOD Troubleshooting
- Information and manual diagnostic guidance only

#### Section 9: Network Optimization
- Additional network guidance

#### Section 10: Disk Cleanup (HIGH RISK)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Deletes system logs** (may be needed for troubleshooting)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Clears browser data** (may cause data loss)
- Empties recycle bin

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Recommendations

### Before Using Either Tool:

1. **Create a Complete System Backup**
2. **Create a System Restore Point**
3. **Have Windows Installation Media Ready**
4. **Test on a Non-Production System First**
5. **Understand Each Operation Before Proceeding**

### Recommended Approach:

1. **Start with the Python GUI**: It's safer and more conservative
2. **Avoid the batch script unless absolutely necessary**
3. **If using the batch script, only run sections 1-3**
4. **Never run all sections of the batch script at once**

## üîÑ Recovery Options

### If System Issues Occur:

1. **Boot into Safe Mode**
2. **Use System Restore** to revert to pre-optimization state
3. **Run Windows Recovery Environment**
4. **Use Windows Installation Media for repair**

### Service Recovery:
- Open `services.msc` as administrator
- Find disabled services and re-enable them
- Set startup type to "Automatic" or "Manual" as needed

---

## üìã System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 (1903+) or Windows 11
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 10GB free space
- **Permissions**: Administrator privileges required
- **Python**: 3.8+ (for GUI application)

---

## üéØ Recommendations by User Type

### **Casual Users**: 
- Use **Python GUI only**
- Select only Network and System Repair options
- Avoid privacy/service modifications

### **Power Users**:
- Start with Python GUI
- If needed, use batch script sections 1-3 only
- Always create restore points

### **IT Professionals**:
- Review all code before execution
- Test on isolated systems first
- Have comprehensive recovery plan
- Consider individual section execution

## üÜò Emergency Contacts

### If System Becomes Unstable:
1. **Windows Recovery Environment**: Boot from installation media
2. **Safe Mode**: F8 during boot or Settings ‚Üí Recovery
3. **System Restore**: Restore to pre-optimization state
4. **Professional Help**: Contact qualified IT support
